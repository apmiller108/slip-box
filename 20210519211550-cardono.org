** Account type
   Etherium uses account ledgers.
** UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) type
   Cardono uses a UTXO ledger.
   - A transaction spends UTXOs and creates more.
   - A transaction only has to deal with the inputs that it spends.
*** Scripts and Extended UTXO
    - Output can be locked by a script (actually a hash of a script). This is
      called "pay to script".
    - A script is a program that decides if a transaction is authorized to spend
      its output. So, it's a validation script.
**** Validator Scripts
     These scripts are passed three args:
     1. ~datum~: Some data/state attached to the locked output. 
     2. ~redeemer~: data attached to the input doing the spending. Input to the
        script from the spender.
     3. ~context~: data about the transaction doing the spending. Makes
        assertions about the way the output is being sent.
