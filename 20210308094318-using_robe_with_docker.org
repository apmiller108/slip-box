- Put [[https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-docker-robe][emacs-docker-robe package]] somewhere in your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][Load Path]] (I put it in
  ~/emacs.d/lisp and added the directory to my load paths)

  [[file:~/.emacs.d/lisp/docker-robe.el][docker-robe.el]] 

  #+begin_src lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
  #+end_src

- You might need to make some changes to the package, for example for some projects
  - set the ~robe-host~ to "0.0.0.0".
  - Added ~-u 0~ to run the ~mkdir~ command as root user.
- eval ~(require 'docker-rob)~
- eval ~(docker-robe:activate)~
- This will start a question set and cache your answers in your emacs directory
  in the file ~.docker-robe-project~
  - Note that it didn't seem to store my answers properly and I had to manually
    edit this file to make the corrections.
