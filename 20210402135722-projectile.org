** Configuration
   Example configuration:
    #+begin_src elisp
      (use-package projectile
        :diminish projectile-mode
        :config (projectile-mode)
        :custom ((projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
        :bind-keymap
        ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
        :init
        (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired))
    #+end_src

    - See [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].
    - [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/diminish][diminish]] hides or abbreviates the mode-line for that mode.
    - The ~init~ block runs /before/ the package is loaded. In this example it
      just sets ~projectile-switch-project-action~ -- which tells projectile what
      to do when switching to a project -- to list the project files.
    - ~config~ is ruby /after/ the package is loaded.

** Some interesting commands
   Most of the stuff you can do with this are discoverable with the keymap
   binding above (Or ~SPC p~ in spacemacs), but some noteworthy things are:
   - ~projectile-edit-dir-locals~
   - ~projectile-find-file-in-known-projects~
