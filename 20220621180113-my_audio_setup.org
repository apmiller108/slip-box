* Midi Clock
  Midi clock signal is generated by the [[https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/red-sound-systems-voyager-1-beat-xtractor][Red Sound Voyager 1]] from the Xone:43
  booth output. The clock signal is routed into Ardour where is it used for
  syncing FXs. The clock isn't reliable enough for drum machines, but good
  enough for FXs.
* Mixxx
  [[https://mixxx.org/][Mixxx]] is used for playing tracks in [[https://manual.mixxx.org/1.11/en/chapters/configuration.html#audio-outputs][external mixer mode]]. Each deck's audio is
  routed to a corresponding channel in Ardour.
* Ardour
  Each channel in [[https://ardour.org/][Ardour]] has a High and Low pass filter to emulate the [[https://playdifferently.org/model1/][Model 1]].
  I love mixing with filters, but won't pay that much for a mixer. Each channel
  also has an external FX send for using the [[https://www.polyeffects.com/polyeffects/p/beebo][Poly Effects Beebo]], and two
  internal FX sends for using various VST plugins (eg, delay and reverb). FXs
  can be synced to the midi clock signal generated by the Red Sound Voyager.
* Midi control
  Both the [[https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xonek2/][Xone:K2]] and the [[https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-twister][Midi Fighter Twister]] are used to control everything
  in Mixxx, Ardour and some stuff on the Beebo.

  See also [[https://github.com/apmiller108/audio/blob/main/mixxx_4_decks_ardour_midi_bindings.map][my Ardour midi binding map]].
* Setup script
  I use a script symlinked into a location in my path so I can just type ~pmixxx~
  to start the programs and make the pipewire connections.
