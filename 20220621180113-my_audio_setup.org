* Midi Clock
  MIDI clock signal is generated by the [[https://github.com/apmiller108/mixxx_midi_clock][Mixxx MIDI clock]] and distributed to
  software and devices over USB and MIDI DIN. This is fundamental to keeping
  external gear like the drum machine in sync with tracks playing in Mixxx.
* Mixxx
  [[https://mixxx.org/][Mixxx]] is used for playing tracks in [[https://manual.mixxx.org/1.11/en/chapters/configuration.html#audio-outputs][external mixer mode]]. Each deck's audio is
  routed to a corresponding channel in Ardour.
* Ardour
  Each channel in [[https://ardour.org/][Ardour]] has a High and Low pass filter to emulate the [[https://playdifferently.org/model1/][Model 1]].
  If find mixing with filters and EQ creates really nice, sound sculpted blends.
  Each channel has two internal FX sends for using various VST plugins (eg,
  delay and reverb). FXs can be synced to the midi clock produced by the Mixxx
  MIDI clock.
* Midi control
  Both the [[https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xonek2/][Xone:K2]] and the [[https://store.djtechtools.com/products/midi-fighter-twister][Midi Fighter Twister]] are used to control everything
  in Mixxx, Ardour and some stuff on the Beebo.

* Other gear
  I'm having a lot of fun incorporating a drum machine and sampler into the
  setup. Right now I'm using a Roland T-8 and TE EP-133 K.O. II.
* Setup script
  I use a script symlinked into a location in my path so I can just type ~pmixxx~
  to start the programs and make the pipewire connections.
