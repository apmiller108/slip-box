* The Camelot Wheel System
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-camelot-wheel-system
  :END:

The Camelot Wheel is a simplified representation of the Circle of
Fifths, designed specifically for DJs. It uses numbers (1-12) to
represent different keys and letters (A for major, B for minor) to
indicate the mode.

*Inner Ring (Major Keys - A):*
- 1A = C Major
- 2A = G Major
- 3A = D Major
- 4A = A Major
- 5A = E Major
- 6A = B Major
- 7A = F# Major
- 8A = C# Major
- 9A = G# Major
- 10A = D# Major
- 11A = A# Major
- 12A = F Major

*Outer Ring (Minor Keys - B):*
- 1B = A Minor
- 2B = E Minor
- 3B = B Minor
- 4B = F# Minor
- 5B = C# Minor
- 6B = G# Minor
- 7B = D# Minor
- 8B = A# Minor
- 9B = F Minor
- 10B = C Minor
- 11B = G Minor
- 12B = D Minor

The following is sourced from https://dj.studio/blog/dj-mix-chart.

** 1. *Perfect Mix*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: perfect-mix
   :END:

- *Rule*: Same key to same key
- *Energy Change*: Neutral
- *Description*: The most seamless transition possible. Both tracks are
  in identical keys, creating perfect harmonic compatibility.
- *Use Case*: Maintaining consistent energy, creating extended mixes

** 2. *Scale Change*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: scale-change
   :END:

- *Rule*: Switch between relative major/minor (A ↔ B)
- *Energy Change*: Neutral to slight mood shift
- *Description*: Major and minor relatives share the same notes but
  different tonal centers. Creates subtle mood changes while maintaining
  harmonic compatibility.
- *Use Case*: Adding emotional variation without energy disruption

** 3. *Energy Boost*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: energy-boost
   :END:

- *Rule*: Move +2 steps clockwise
- *Energy Change*: Dramatic increase
- *Description*: Raises the key by a major second interval, creating a
  noticeable lift in energy and excitement.
- *Use Case*: Peak moments, building to drops, creating climactic
  moments

** 4. *+1 Mix*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mix
   :END:

- *Rule*: Move +1 step clockwise
- *Energy Change*: Slight increase
- *Description*: Moves up by a perfect fifth interval, creating a gentle
  energy boost that feels natural and uplifting.
- *Use Case*: Gradual energy building, smooth progression upward

** 5. *-1 Mix*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mix-1
   :END:

- *Rule*: Move -1 step counterclockwise
- *Energy Change*: Slight decrease
- *Description*: Moves down by a perfect fifth interval, creating a
  subtle energy drop while maintaining harmonic compatibility.
- *Use Case*: Gentle energy reduction, creating breathing room in sets

** 6. *Diagonal Mix*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: diagonal-mix
   :END:

- *Rule*: Move diagonally across the wheel
- *Energy Change*: Varies

  across the wheel, often used for creative transitions.
- *Use Case*: Surprising transitions, creative mixing, genre changes

** 7. *Jaw's Mix*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: jaws-mix
   :END:

- *Rule*: Specific harmonic intervals

- *Description*: Named after DJ Jaw, these are specific harmonic
  relationships that create unique but compatible transitions.
- *Use Case*: Advanced mixing techniques, creating signature sounds

** 8. *Mood Shifter*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mood-shifter
   :END:

- *Rule*: Switch major/minor + move 3 steps clockwise
- *Energy Change*: Dramatic mood change
- *Description*: Combines a mode change with a significant key shift,
  creating dramatic emotional transitions while maintaining harmonic
  compatibility.

   :CUSTOM_ID: advanced-techniques
   :END:

*** *Multi-Key Transitions*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: multi-key-transitions
    :END:

Chain multiple harmonic relationships for extended mixes:
- 1A → 2A → 3A (gradual energy building)
- 5A → 5B → 8B (mood shift with energy change)

*** *Genre Bridging*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: genre-bridging
    :END:

Use harmonic mixing to transition between different genres while
maintaining musical coherence.
