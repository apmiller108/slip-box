* FOR UPDATE
  This clause is used as part of a select query and can define:
  - The lock strength. See also https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS
  - Name the specific tables in the query whose rows should be locked. If no
    table is specified, all tables used in the query are locked.
  - What action to take if encountering lock contention

  See also https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE

* Advisory Locks
  These aren't row locks, but worth mentioning. You can use these to control
  concurrency in general, even things not explicitly tied to data in the
  database.
