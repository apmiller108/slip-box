* org-map-entries
** Counting entries (headlines)
   This is probably the most basic use case for this. I needed in [[file:publish.org][publish.org]] to
   count the number of headlines. I add a table of contents export option only
   when there are more than 3 headlines in an org note.

   Get the number of headlines 
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (length (org-map-entries t))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
