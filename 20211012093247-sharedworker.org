* Key points
  - Can be accessed from difference browsing contexts (windows/tabs iframes,
    workers) within the same origin (protocol, host and port)
  - Inherits properties and methods (eg, ~addEventListener()~) from [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget][EventTarget]]
  - Messages can be sent and received over the ~port~ property (ie, ~onmessage~,
    ~postMessage~)
  - The JS code running in SharedWorkers do not have access to cookies. They
    have their own scope (see self below)
* Debugging
** Chrome
   Visit ~chrome://inspect/#workers~. A SharedWorker context will have its own
   dev tools.
** Firefox
   Visit ~about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox~
* self
  The ~self~ keyword in a SharedWorker context refers to the
  [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorkerGlobalScope][SharedWorkerGlobalScope]]. There is no ~window~ object here (ie, use
  ~self.setInterval()~)

  See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/11237259/5974855
** Singletons
   If you need to share a singleton class across browser contexts/windows (ie a
   WebSocket connection or something that has some persistent state/connection),
   attach it to the ~SharedWorkerGlobalScope~ (ie ~self~) object and check if it
   already exists before attempting to instantiate it again (ie when opening
   another browser tab). If you just assign it to a ~const~, then you'll end up
   re-instantiating the thing.

    #+begin_src javascript
      // shared-worker.ts
      import SuperAwesomeThing from './SuperAwesomeThing';

      // self is that SharedWorkerGlobalScope
      const swgs = self as any;

      swgs.onconnect = function(e: MessageEvent) {
        const port = e.ports[0];

        if (!swgs.superAwesomeThing) {
          swgs.superAwesomeThing = new SuperAwesomeThing();
          swgs.superAwesomeThing.init();
        }
      };
    #+end_src

* Webpack stuff
** For Webpack v4
   Use [[https://v4.webpack.js.org/loaders/worker-loader/#worker][worker-loader]]
   - I could not get this to work consistently using a webpackChain rule. I had to
     use an [[https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#inline][inline loader]].
   - See also https://github.com/dynamind/minimal-vue-worker#webpack-loader-configuration
** For Webpack v5
   You don't need worker-loader. Webpack v5 has built-in support for workers.
   See also https://webpack.js.org/guides/web-workers/
* Vite
  https://v3.vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#web-workers
* Resources
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker
  - https://github.com/mdn/simple-shared-worker
    This demonstrates using a shared worker to perform simply multiplication
    operations for two browsing contexts.
