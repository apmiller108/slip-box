* Typescript
** Setup
   - I choose to use [[https://github.com/theia-ide][theia-ide]] setup. See also https://theia-ide.org/.
     - Requires the [[https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server][typescript-language-server]] to be installed.
   - Follow the lsp-mode [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-typescript/][setup instructions]].

* Performance
  I had performance issues with LSP mode, especially with Typescript.

  See https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/ for suggestions.

  I increased the ~read-process-output-max~ to 3mb and that seemed to help.

  I was already using emacs v28, so I just rebuild it with native comp. There
  was some pain making the transition, but it completely solved the performance
  issues.

  See https://xenodium.com/emacs-plus-with-native-comp/
  and https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus#emacs-27-and-emacs-28-options
