https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/ruby/README.html#language-server-protocol

* Typescript
** Setup
   - I choose to use [[https://github.com/theia-ide][theia-ide]] setup. See also https://theia-ide.org/.
     - Requires the [[https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server][typescript-language-server]] to be installed.
   - Follow the lsp-mode [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-typescript/][setup instructions]].
* Ruby
  There are a bunch of options for LSP servers. You can have multiple servers
  and the one used can be specified in a dir-local file
  See also [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/faq/#i-have-multiple-language-servers-registered-for-language-foo-which-one-will-be-used-when-opening-a-project][emacs-lsp FAQ]]
** Ruby LSP
   https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp
   This requires putting it in the Gemfile, so kind of a non-starter.
** Solargraph
   - https://github.com/castwide/solargraph
   - https://solargraph.org/guides

   It doesn't require [[https://yardoc.org/features.html][yard]], but it can help it out.
*** Setup
    Just follow the instructions linked above. For spacemacs, set the ruby-mode
    backend to ~'lsp~
**** Rails
     Use the [[https://github.com/iftheshoefritz/solargraph-rails/][solargraph-rails]] plugin. When using this you'll need to include
     ~"**/*.rb"~ and use the exclude directive in the .solargraph.yml
*** Features
    - autocompletion
    - other things...

* Performance
  I had performance issues with LSP mode, especially with Typescript.

  See https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/ for suggestions.

  I increased the ~read-process-output-max~ to 3mb and that seemed to help.

  I was already using emacs v28, so I just rebuild it with native comp. There
  was some pain making the transition, but it completely solved the performance
  issues.

  See https://xenodium.com/emacs-plus-with-native-comp/
  and https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus#emacs-27-and-emacs-28-options
