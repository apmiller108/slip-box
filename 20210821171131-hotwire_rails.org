* What is this?
  [[https://hotwired.dev/][Hotwire]] is a way of building web applications that, at its core, is about
  sending server rendered HTML over "this wire" (ie, HTTP or websocket). It is
  composed of three things:

  1. [[https://turbo.hotwired.dev/][Turbo]]: This is really the main thing. With this library alone, we can do
     HTML over the wire.
  2. [[https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/][Stimulus]]: A JS framework that doesn't care about rendering stuff, but
     rather with dynamic behavior typical of an SPA.
  3. Strada: something to do with mobile -- not sure. As now this moment it has
     not been made public


  See https://github.com/hotwired for all the libraries.

* Add to Rails application

  Add the ~hotwire-rails~ gem. Follow the instructions in the [[https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-rails][Readme]].

  NOTE:
  - This appears to basically be a wrapper for [[https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails][turbo-rails]] and
    [[https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus-rails][stimulus-rails]].
  - The ~hotwire:install~ rake task will ~yarn add~ both NPM packages
    ~@hotwired/turbo-rails~ and ~stimulus~.
