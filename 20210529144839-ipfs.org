[[https://ipfs.io/][InterPlanetary File System]]

* Overview
  - Peer-to-peer network and protocol.
  - File contents are stored on distributed nodes.
  - Uses content addressing (ie, a hash of the file's contents)
    - Still, there's a naming system behind this called IPNS so a file can be
      found be either it's hash or name.
  - Relies on the concept of [[https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/#three-kinds-of-pins][pinning]] to persist files and prevent then
    from being garbage collected. Pinning can be done on your local IPFS node
    you can use pay for a 3rd party service like [[https://pinata.cloud/][Pinata]].
  - Users can interact with IPFS with a [[https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/command-line-quick-start/][CLI]] or the [[https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop][Desktop app]].
  - You can host static websites on IPFS.

* My Take on this
  - This could be considered a data layer for the internet.
  - The pinning concept is strange. With 3rd party services, we're back to just
    cloud storage like DropBox, so what gives?
  - Using IPFS for NFTs seems risky. What if I lose my node or the 3rd party
    service goes out of business?
