* First attempt 2023-04-01
  We've never done vegetable gardening. Now that we're living that country life
  in the Southeast US, we figured we'd give it a try. After reading blog posts
  (like [[https://www.planetnatural.com/raised-bed-soil/][this one)]] and videos on YouTube (like [[https://youtu.be/ckgLec0eudc][this one)]], we decided on DIY soil
  since it would be cheaper than buying "premium" raised gardening soil at over
  $10/bag. We did go a little off script, with our soil mix, mostly to keep cost
  down further, but figured we captured the spirit of the conventional wisdom of
  DIY soil mixing.
** The soil mix
   We have one 4' x 8' raised bed.
   
   FYI mixing soil is hard work.
*** Ingredients
    - Around 3 ft^{3} of compost composed of mostly leaves and some food waste.
      This wasn't very well decomposed yet.
    - 4 1/2 ft^{3} of Scott's Topsoil (contains sphagnum peat moss and organic
      matter)
    - 6 ft^{3} of American Countryside Topsoil (consists of composted bark,
      forest products and sand)
    - 3 ft^{3} of Peat moss. This helps with water and nutrient retention, but is
      acidic so don't use too much.
    - 3 ft^{3} of Black Kow. Contains cow manure. It helps to increase nutrient
      content. 
    - 24 Qt of perlite. This supports aeration and drainage. Prevents soil
      compaction so plants to take root easily.
    - 1 1/2 cups of Dr. Earth Pure Gold All Purpose Fertilizer.

**** Soil ecosystem
     The fundamental aim is to create soil where organic matter is converted
     though natural processes into *nitrogen*, *phosphorous* and *potassium*
     which are in turn ingested by the plants. Organic matter is converted into
     these elements in a couple of ways:
     1. Bacteria, through extracellular digestion. That is they digest the
        organic matter outside the cell wall, then consume it. This process
        converts organic matter into the above elements. These bacteria are
        brought into the soil mixture with manure and compost.
     2. Larger organisms, like insects and worms consume organic matter. It is
        their waste products that feed plants. For example, worm castings (their
        poop) is like concentrated nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. These
        soil organisms are brought into the soil ecosystem via compost.

     Plants consume nitrogen through water absorption, which is why we want
     aeration. Plants consume phosphorous and potassium through roots in contact
     with the soil.

** What we planted
   This month (April):
   1. onions
   2. carrots
   3. tomatoes
      
   We also planted in separate pots
   1. Basil
   2. Catnip
   3. Snowsurfer Forte Candytuft (an early spring perennial flower)

   Next month (May) we will plant:
   1. Zucchini
   2. Squash

** Monday April 10th, 2023
   This is perhaps our first tomato
