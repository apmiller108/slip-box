* First attempt 2023-04-01
  We've never done vegetable gardening. now that we're living on a good
  amount of land in the southeast US country, we figured we'd give it a try.
  After reading blog posts (like [[https://www.planetnatural.com/raised-bed-soil/][this one)]] on the internet and videos on YouTube
  (like [[https://youtu.be/ckgLec0eudc][this one)]], we decided on DIY soil since it would be cheaper than buying
  "premium" raised gardening soil at over $10/bag. We did go a little off
  script, with our soil mix, mostly to keep cost down further, but figured we
  captured the spirit of the conventional wisdom of DIY soil mixing.
** The soil mix
   FYI mixing soil is hard work.
*** Ingredients
    - Around ft^{3} of compost composed of mostly leaves and some food waste.
      This wasn't very well decomposed yet.
    - 4 1/2 ft^{3} of Scott's Topsoil (contains sphagnum peat moss and organic
      matter)
    - 6 ft^{3} of American Countryside Topsoil (consists of composted bark,
      forest products and sand)
    - 3 ft^{3} of Peat moss. This helps with water and nutrient retention, but is
      acidic so don't use too much.
    - 3 ft^{3} of Black Kow. Contains cow manure. It supposed to increase nutrient
      content.
    - 24 Qt of perlite. This supports aeration and drainage. Prevents soil
      compaction so plants to take root easily.
    - 1 1/2 cups of Dr. Earth Pure Gold All Purpose Fertilizer.
