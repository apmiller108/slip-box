* Channels
  - Each MIDI connections can communicate of 16 channels (0-15)
  - MIDI devices can switch channels they send messages over.
  - Devices listening for message can selectively listen on specific channels,
    or all channels at once.
* Anatomy of a MIDI message
  - MIDI messages are composed of several bytes. Just how many depends on the
    type of messages
  - The first byte is called the ~Status Byte~ and it has two parts, the message
    type and the channel information. 
    - Channel info is the four least significant bits
    - Message info is the first four bits
    - The top most bit is always set. This identifies the first byte as the one
      containing the message type and channel info.
  - The subsequent bytes contain the message data.
    - The top bit is unset.

** Note On example
*** Status Byte (first byte)
   | Message Type | Channel |
   |--------------+---------|
   | 1 0 0 1      | 0 1 0 0 |

   - Top bit is set
   - Message type: 9 = Note On
   - Channel: 4 = Channel 5

*** Data Bytes
   | Byte             | Value | Data     |
   |------------------+-------+----------|
   | 0 0 1 1  1 1 0 0  |    60 | Note     |
   | 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  |   127 | Velocity |

   - Top bits are unset indicating these are the message values
   - 127 is therefore the maximum value
