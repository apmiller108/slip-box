* Customize faces for modes
  I don't like how the ~dakrone~ theme colors the ~org-level-3~ face. It's the same
  color as a link. One way to solve it is to create a custom function that
  changes the face and add it to the ~org-mode-hook~.

  #+begin_src elisp
    (defun my/org-mode-faces ()
      "Org-mode face remapping for `org-mode-hook'."
      (when (string-equal "dakrone" spacemacs--cur-theme)
        (face-remap-add-relative 'org-level-3
                                :foreground "dark magenta")))
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (my/org-mode-faces)))
  #+end_src
