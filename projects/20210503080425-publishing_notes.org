* Version 0.2 TODOs
** TODO make the tags a select box
** TODO Include org-roam backlinks in each note
*** Example  
   - https://doubleloop.net/2020/08/21/how-publish-org-roam-wiki-org-publish/
   - https://gitlab.com/ngm/commonplace/-/blob/master/publish.el#L176-190
    
*** Idea
   This would involve querying against the sqllite database which creates some
   additional complexity in the build process.
   - Add org-roam to the publish script dependencies.
   - Set the database slip box location and make sure it matches what  I have set
     locally. Create the dir in the CI script.
     #+begin_src elisp
       (setq org-roam-directory "~/slip-box")
     #+end_src
   - Call ~(org-roam-db-build-cache)~ which I think will create the database.
   - Then follow the example above and hope for the best.
