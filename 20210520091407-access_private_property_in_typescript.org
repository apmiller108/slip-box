* Why
  There are rare occasions when writing unit tests where I need to verify the
  value of a private property on a Typescript object instance.
  
* Remove the type checking on the instance

  Imagine ~SomeObject~ has a private property called ~PrivateProp~. We can skip
  the type checking using ~any~ [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions][type assertion]].

  #+begin_src javascript
    it('equals some value', () => {
      const someObject = new SomeObject();
      expect((<any>someObject).privateProp).to.eq 'some value';
    });
  #+end_src

  This could also be expresses as ~(someObject as any)~
