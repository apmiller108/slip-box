[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is the central component to this layer. Learning how to use it is key.

Some useful commands listed here, but mostly it's easy to discover what you
can do by pressing ~?~ while in a Magit buffer. Change

| Key       | Command                   | Notes                                   |
|-----------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| ~SPC g L~ | ~magit-list-repositories~ | Requires ~magit-repository-directories~ |
| ~SPC g s~ | ~magit-status~            | Press ~?~ for menu.                     |

- Unmerged commits will show at the top of the git status screen.

* Rebasing
 Only a few things in Magit are not intuitive. Rebasing is one of them.

** Interactive with ~-i~ flag
 - ~r -i~ starts an interactive rebase
 - Choose what to rebase onto (tip you're not limited to the options presented
   and can override this with whatever you want like ~HEAD~2~ or something)
 - Nagivate up and down and press the letter corresponding to the action (eg
   ~s~ to squash)
 - ~C-c C-c~ to commit and proceed to the next prompt or finish.
