* Magit
  [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is the central component to this layer. Learning how to use it is key.

  Some useful commands listed here, but mostly it's easy to discover what you
  can do by pressing ~?~ while in a Magit buffer. Change

  | Key       | Command                   | Notes                                   |
  |-----------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
  | ~SPC g L~ | ~magit-list-repositories~ | Requires ~magit-repository-directories~ |
  | ~SPC g s~ | ~magit-status~            | Press ~?~ for menu.                     |

  - Unmerged commits will show at the top of the git status screen.
    
** Rebasing
   Only a few things in Magit are not intuitive. Rebasing is one of them.

*** Interactive   
   -  ~g -i~ starts an interactive rebase
   - Nagivate up and down and press the letter corresponding to the action (eg
     ~s~ to squash)
   - ~C-c C-c~ to proceed to the next prompt or finish.
