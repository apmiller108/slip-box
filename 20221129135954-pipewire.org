* GUI
  [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/rncbc/qpwgraph][qpwgraph]] works just like qjackctl
* Scripting
  See https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/Migrate-JACK
** pw-link
   Manage IO connections. Takes the place of ~jack_connect~, ~jack_disconnect~
   and ~jack_lsp~
* Issues
** Volume very low
*** Set volume using a mixer tool
**** alsamixer
   Use ~alsamixer~ tool and set the output gain to whatever.

   - See also https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Low_volume
   - You can store the alsa config by using ~alsactl~

     #+begin_src shell
     sudo alsactl store
     #+end_src
**** pavucontrol
   Pipewire works with Pulse audio, so pavucontrol should work as well. In fact,
   I had better luck with this to set the volume level my Xone k2
**** amixer
     Like alsamixer, but CLI only (no TUI)
