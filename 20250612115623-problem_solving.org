Non-exhaustive general guidelines for problem solving

* For narrowly focused problems
  - Simulate the problem. Imagine having to solve the problem manually and codify
    that. Translate what youâ€™d do manually into loops, conditionals and state
    tracking.
  - Break it down into discrete steps.
  - Keep track of state. Identify things that change, things that persist and
    what must be put into memory to be referenced later to complete other steps.
  - Visualize progress. Log data to the console as the program progresses.
  - Recognize patterns
  - Write tests for base and edge cases
* For broadly focused problems
  - Study the problem space. Discuss and document the details. Understand the
     domain.
  - Design the most optimum solution
  - Design the simplest solution that would lead to the optimum solution
  - Include plan to gather performance data
