  See [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/15725437/5974855][this StackOverflow answer]].

  One option is to redefine the function after the package is loaded. So, use
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hooks-for-Loading.html][eval-after-load]].

  This is how I overrode rspec-mode's function to use spring by only checking
  the flag rather than all the additional PID checking it was originally doing.
  I did this so I could more easily use with Docker.

  #+begin_src elisp
  (eval-after-load 'rspec-mode
    '(defun rspec-spring-p () 'rspec-use-spring-when-possible)
    )
  #+end_src

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html][Advising Functions]] is more appropriate for adding callbacks to existing behavior.
