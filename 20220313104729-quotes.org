Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe
that you are being harmed. If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that
your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we
not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you
will find it easier to maintain control.
