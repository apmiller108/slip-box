 [[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html][Action Text]] uses the [[https://trix-editor.org/][Trix Editor]]. Out of the box it comes with a style sheet
 that actually does a rather good job of providing basic styling. Without any
 styles, the editor is usable, but very raw.

 If using a CSS framework that has utility classes, with SCSS, the Trix and
 Action Text classes can be made to extend from the CSS framework classes. For
 example, have the attachment caption extend from several bootstrap utility
 classes.

  #+begin_src scss
    // app/assets/stylesheets/actiontext.scss
    @import 'trix/dist/trix'; // Optionally use Trix's provided stylesheet as a starter
    action-text-attachment {
      .attachment__caption {
        @extend .fw-light, .text-center, .text-black-50;
      }
    }
  #+end_src
