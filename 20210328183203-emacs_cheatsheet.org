* Emacs cheatsheet
  This is just a dump or random things I learn how to do but probably wont
  remember exactly how to do them.

  *Word Wrapping*

  - ~auto-fill-mode~ is what you need. This will automatically wrap words after
    the line exceeds whatever value is set for [[elisp:(describe-variable 'fill-column)][fill-column]]

    For example, turn it on for org-mode
    #+begin_src elisp
      (setq-default fill-column 80)
      (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (auto-fill-mode 1)))
    #+end_src
