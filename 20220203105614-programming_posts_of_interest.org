This is list a list of programming articles that I find interesting and may want
to reference again in the future. For now I'm going to organize them by language
and/or framework.

* Ruby
  - [[https://longliveruby.com/articles/build-your-own-concurrency-control-in-sidekiq][Build concurrency control in Sidekiq]]
    This tutorial article shows how one can leverage Redis to lock resources.
    It's context is locking Sidekiq jobs, but it would be easily repurposed to
    lock anything. Also, worth noting, the paid version of Sidekiq (Sidekiq ENT)
    already has a [[https://github-wiki-see.page/m/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Unique-Jobs][unique_for option]]. The general pattern/algorithm this article
    demonstrates is also discussed in the [[https://redis.io/topics/distlock][Distributed locks with Redis docs]].
