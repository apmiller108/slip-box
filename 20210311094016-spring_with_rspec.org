#+title: Spring with RSpec
#+date: 2021-03-11 09:40 AM
#+roam_tags: spring rspec ruby

* With docker images build for a different environment
  Consider this a case where you can't immediately use gems in the ~group :development~
  You might have a ~/bundle/config~ file that looks like:

  #+begin_example
  ---
  BUNDLE_WITHOUT: "development"
  #+end_example

  - ~bundle config unset --local without~ : Removes the ~BUNDLE_WITHOUT~ setting.
  - ~bundle install~ : Will install the development environment gems.
  - ~bin/spring rspec~ : Use Spring
