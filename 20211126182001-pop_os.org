* Compiler toolchain
  For Pop_Os and Ubuntu install ~build-essential~. Contains things like G++/GCC,
  GNU Debugger and other packages for compiling C/C++
  
  #+begin_src shell
  sudo apt-get install build-essential 
  #+end_src

* Logs
  There are different types of logs and they're all located in ~/var/log/~.
  Sometimes applications will write logs here too.

** USB logs
   In the kernel logs

   #+begin_src shell
   tail -f /var/log/kern.log | grep usb
   #+end_src
