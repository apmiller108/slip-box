  - Swipe four fingers left opens the Workspaces view
  - Swipe four fingers up or down switches to another workspace
  - Swipe (in any direction) with three fingers switches between open windows

* Shortcuts
  See also [[https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-keyboard-shortcuts/][pop keyboard shortcuts]] post for a complete list. Here are just a few
  that I like to use, but always forget.
  
  | Shortcut           | Action                                                           |
  |--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | SUPER + HJKL       | Switch window focus                                              |
  | SUPER + ENTER      | Window adjustment mode. Use direction keys (HJKL) to move window |
  | SUPER + g          | Toggle window float                                              |
  | SUPER + CTRL + JK  | Navigate between work spaces                                     |
  | SUPER + SHIFT + JK | Move active window between workspaces.                           |
  | SUPER + ESC        | Lock                                                             |
  | SUPER + T          | Open a terminal                                                  |
  
** Launcher Shortcuts
   SUPER opens the launcher. ~?~ shows all the possible commands.
   | Shortcut      | action                               |
   |---------------+--------------------------------------|
   | / or ~/       | browse filesystem                    |
   | file filename | Search for a file                    |
   | t:            | run command in terminal              |
   | g search_term | search Google (ddg for duck duck go) |

* Compiler toolchain
  For Pop_Os and Ubuntu install ~build-essential~. Contains things like G++/GCC,
  GNU Debugger and other packages for compiling C/C++
  
  #+begin_src shell
  sudo apt-get install build-essential 
  #+end_src

* Logs
  There are different types of logs and they're all located in ~/var/log/~.
  Sometimes applications will write logs here too.

** USB logs
   In the kernel logs

   #+begin_src shell
   tail -f /var/log/kern.log | grep usb
   #+end_src

* Wake from suspend on USB device input
  The following should work on other Linux distros.
** Gathering Bus and device info  
*** See which devices are wakeup disabled
     #+begin_src shell
     grep . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-14/power/wakeup:disabled  |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-2/power/wakeup:disabled   |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-4.1/power/wakeup:enabled  |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-4.3/power/wakeup:disabled |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-4.4/power/wakeup:disabled |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/3-4/power/wakeup:disabled   |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/4-2/power/wakeup:disabled   |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/power/wakeup:disabled  |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb2/power/wakeup:disabled  |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb3/power/wakeup:disabled  |
     | /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb4/power/wakeup:disabled  |

*** List devices and Buses
    List all your device names, vendor ID, product ID along with the Bus number
    they are using:
    - vendor ID is left side of the colon
    - product ID is right side of the colon
     #+begin_src shell
       lsusb
     #+end_src
     
    You can list devices by product name. Might be useful in some cases.
     #+begin_src shell
       grep . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/product
     #+end_src

** Create a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/udev][udev rule]] to configure the device for wakeup
